        <p><strong>Haxby</strong> <em>n</em>: Any garden implement found in a potting shed whose exact 
purpose is unclear.</p>

<p><em>Definition borrowed from "The Meaning of Liff" by Douglas Adams and 
John Lloyd</em></p>

<h1>WARNING</h1>

<p>Please note that this project is still under development. It may be a bit
difficult to figure out or use. I will be making it more usable as time allows.</p>

<p>Feel free to message me to ask how it works.</p>

<h1>Purpose</h1>

<p>Haxby is a quick and easy way to get a Postgresql database up and running. It
is primarily intended for developemental efforts.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>Commands in haxby are executed using modes, ala <code>haxby init</code> or <code>haxby stop</code>.</p>

<p>A general workflow for haxby is to create a database with <code>haxby newdb name</code>
then initialize and start the database with <code>haxby init</code></p>

<p>Adding a config file may be a good idea too! So long as you are in a git
repository (and why wouldn't you be) you can put a file named <code>haxby.conf</code>
anywhere (in the repo, that is) and haxby will find it. An example config is
available in the source tree.</p>

<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>You will need postgres. This is currently only tested on Homebrew Postgres 9.X
but it should work on prior versions and other platforms.</p>

<p>If you hit issues with shared memory (on mac), you are probably running more
than one instance of postgres. Don't do that. If you really need to though,
take a look at this document: <a href="http://jeffammons.net/2011/09/fixing-postgres-on-mac-10-7-tiger-for-django/">http://jeffammons.net/2011/09/fixing-postgres-on-mac-10-7-tiger-for-django/</a></p>
