{"name":"Haxby","body":"**Haxby** _n_: Any garden implement found in a potting shed whose exact \r\npurpose is unclear.\r\n\r\n_Definition borrowed from \"The Meaning of Liff\" by Douglas Adams and \r\nJohn Lloyd_\r\n\r\n# WARNING\r\nPlease note that this project is still under development. It may be a bit\r\ndifficult to figure out or use. I will be making it more usable as time allows.\r\n\r\nFeel free to message me to ask how it works.\r\n\r\n# Purpose\r\nHaxby is a quick and easy way to get a Postgresql database up and running. It\r\nis primarily intended for developemental efforts.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\nCommands in haxby are executed using modes, ala `haxby init` or `haxby stop`.\r\n\r\nA general workflow for haxby is to create a database with `haxby newdb name`\r\nthen initialize and start the database with `haxby init`\r\n\r\nAdding a config file may be a good idea too! So long as you are in a git\r\nrepository (and why wouldn't you be) you can put a file named `haxby.conf`\r\nanywhere (in the repo, that is) and haxby will find it. An example config is\r\navailable in the source tree.\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\nYou will need postgres. This is currently only tested on Homebrew Postgres 9.X\r\nbut it should work on prior versions and other platforms.\r\n\r\nIf you hit issues with shared memory (on mac), you are probably running more\r\nthan one instance of postgres. Don't do that. If you really need to though,\r\ntake a look at this document: http://jeffammons.net/2011/09/fixing-postgres-on-mac-10-7-tiger-for-django/\r\n\r\n# Initial Contributors\r\nSome contributions were wiped out in the creation of the repo, they are listed\r\nhere\r\n\r\n[adinardi](https://github.com/adinardi)\r\n[danw](https://github.com/danw)","tagline":"Making development postgres setups almost painless","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
